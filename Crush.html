        ‎Hi po rosie koo!! Happy valentines day😁. 
‎
‎Thank you for longing and staying up until now even tho we had a conflict back then, that just shows how you really like/love me.  It really melts my heart since you're the first genuinely person to actually love me like this, and I'm so thankful that God had answered to my prayers that someone like you will eventually accept me. Im so glad to meet you Rosey😁😁, I wanted to give you some gift but distance is our enemy. 
‎
‎I really like/love you, not just you. 
‎
‎<H1> EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU CUTIE. </H1>
‎
‎There maybe not much from me but I'm certain that I can love you at fullest.  I hope that one day we can now actually meet, so I can show how I'm really glad to yours.
‎
‎I really wanna be yours, I wanna hold your hands, I want us to have fun, I want us to walk together, there's a lot more of things that we haven't done so I'm hoping that we can do this when we met😁😁, 
‎
‎Thanks for always understanding me and being kind to me, I'm more glad than u could've imagine.  thank u so much po cutie🥰.
